# Simples: Personal Finance Without the Hassle

## What It Does

**Simples** gives you complete control over your finances without the tedious work. Upload your bank CSV once a month, and it automatically tracks everything—transactions, categories, budgets, and your actual net worth. No spreadsheets. No manual entry. No guesswork.

## The Problem It Solves

You want to know where your money goes, but you don't want to spend hours managing it. Bank apps show transactions but don't help you understand patterns. Budgeting apps are either too simple or way too complicated. Spreadsheets are error-prone and boring.

**Simples solves this:** *Control your money with minimal effort.*

## How It Works

**Upload & Go:** Download your CSV from any bank, upload it, and Simples handles the rest. It matches transactions automatically, learns your spending patterns, and categorizes everything. Takes 5 minutes a month.

**Smart Matching:** The system automatically matches your transactions to bank statements using intelligent algorithms. You just review the few unmatched items—no manual line-by-line comparison.

**Learns Your Habits:** Categorize a transaction once, and Simples remembers. "STARBUCKS" → "Coffee"? Got it. Next time it suggests automatically. Gets smarter every month.

**Real Budgets:** Set budgets by category, see if you're on track with visual progress bars. Know exactly where you're overspending before it's too late.

**True Net Worth:** See your actual financial position—assets minus liabilities. Not just account balances, but your real net worth calculated correctly.
